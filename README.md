# A1 population correlations vs. behavior
Manuscript investigating the relationship between neural correlations, behavior, and neural decoding. Show that while behavior modulates neural correlations, these changes do not impact neural decoding. Likewise, behavior performance does not directly correlated with optimal linear decoding of task stimuli in A1. Use datasets across three different behaviors: PTD, BVT, TBP -- vary in behavioral task and/or auditory stimuli used.

### TODO

* State-dependent noise correlations (pairwise) -- w/ and w/o pupil regressed
* State-dependent optimal decoding (with cross-validation -- leave one out?) -- w/ and w/o pupil regressed
* Single trial readouts of optimal decoding / noise correlation
* Correlations might matter for within category discrimination (target vs. target) but not the task relevant category
