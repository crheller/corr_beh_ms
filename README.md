# A1 population correlations vs. behavior
Manuscript investigating the relationship between neural correlations, behavior, and neural decoding. Show that while behavior modulates neural correlations, these changes do not impact neural decoding. Likewise, behavior performance does not directly correlated with optimal linear decoding of task stimuli in A1.
